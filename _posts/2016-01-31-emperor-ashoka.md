If you look up the Secret Society of the Nine Unknown Men online you will find several sites with redundant information to the point of plagiarism without restraint. I would recommend a good book or two on the subject if you can find them. In the meantime I'm going to regurgitate some of the common point available online to help clue you in on some of the characters origins.

Today we will look at the Indian Emperor Ashoka and why he formed the Nine Unknown Men.

Around 273 BC an Indian Emperor called Ashoka, Grandson of Chandragupta, attempted to unify India. Following in his ancestor's footsteps, Ashoka laid waste to Kalinga massacring 100,000 Kalingans. The Kalinga region used to exist between what is now known as Calcutta and Madras. Ashoka, in the after mass of the devastation, was overcome with guilt.

There is a famous quote, "What Have I done?!" attributed to Ashoka as he ventured out to purvey the burnt homes and masses of corpses. This sight made him sick to the point of after his return to Pataliputra, he could not sleep and was constantly haunted by his deeds in Kalinga. His resolve was set to follow the path of non-violence.

Reflecting on the brutality his conquest, Ashoka turned to Buddhism with Brahmin Buddhist sages Radhaswami and Manjushri as his guides. He was Hindu by birth. It was the exalted position as Emperor that helped elevate and disseminate the relatively new philosophy as far as ancient Rome and Egypt.

It was after the brutal massacre at Kalinga and his conversion to Buddhism that Ashoka founded what is quite likely the oldest and most powerful secret society on Earth: The Nine Unknown Men. Ashoka's intent was for the Nine Unknown Men to preserve and develop knowledge that would be dangerous to humanity if it fell into the wrong hands. Some legends go as far as including the Emperor's desire to conceal scientific knowledge from the Rama Empire which according to Hindu scripture was destroyed by advanced weaponry some 15,000 years ago.

Mind you this is a very loose outline leaving out much of Ashoka's accomplishments. I'll delve more into detail later.
