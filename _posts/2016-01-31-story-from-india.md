Once in Kerala, India a Brahmin (priest) did a very special Pooja for a King so that this king could achieves auspicious powers as that of Lord Indra (king of Heavenly Entities). When this Pooja reached its end Lord Indra complained to Lord Narayana (Maha Vishnu -- One of the Trinities in Hinduism) about losing his kingdom because of a worldly King achieving such Powers.

To stop this from coming to pass, Indra was sent to the Brahmin and requested him to stop. The Brahmin said the Pooja is being conducted as per the King's direction and could only end by the Kings decision.

They went to the King to make the request. Being of a good heart, the King asked the Brahmin to stop the Pooja. Then the Brahmin said, "Now that the King has requested to stop the Pooja, I will stop it only if I can meet Lord Narayana."

There was an unwritten rule that no human being can ever see Lord Narayana with his eyes. The Brahmin insisted and there was no stopping the Pooja other than for Lord Narayana to appear before him. It was done.

From that day on, those of the Brahmin's family have received a name of 'Netra Narayana' (Those who have seen Lord Narayana with their own eyes) and the priest from this particular family do not bang the bell in a temple as priests are supposed to for direct contact with the Lord.

This practice still persists in this family and there are supposed to be many amazing stories about them in many epics. If anyone has a story like this to share about the Mezhathur Agnihotri or Netra Narayana please share it here!

The family of these priests is now known as Mezhathur Agnihotri and the members of this family are still alive today (I can not verify this of course . . . ).
